# Code of Conduct

This document provides community guidelines for a safe, respectful, productive,
and collaborative place for any person who is willing to contribute to the
associated project. It applies to all "collaborative space", which is defined as
community communications channels (such as mailing lists, submitted patches,
commit comments, etc.).

- Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.
- Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal
  attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
- When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always
  assume good intentions.
- Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.

# Apolitical Stance

Politics not directly relevant to the project or community should not be
discussed or mentioned in project spaces. We are here to enjoy working together
on creating software (with equity and parity, regardless of our background or
identity) not to push personal politics onto others.

# Affective Stance

Ultimately, a "code" of conduct is only a guideline. Participants are encouraged
to become harmless (i.e., being sans malice) in all of their interactions, for
it will make such ethics and guidelines utterly redundant.
